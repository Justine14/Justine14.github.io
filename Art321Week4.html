The data being sent across communication links that I would like to take a look at initially starts with the number of zeroes being sent across to process cryptocurrency. Since cryptocurrency is a growing trend among individuals, I wanted to be able to count the number of zeroes an individual uses to make their deposits within a year. Then I want to take the average of those zeroes to determine the approximate average of how much a person deposits. For example, if a person deposits $100.00 for 9 months and $10.00 for 3 months, then it would show that the user likes to deposit more in the hundreds since there are two zeroes in front of the decimal point.

This can help with aiming specific philantrophic goals that are within the hundreds towards the individual. In other words, if they like depositing in the hundreds, then they will have suggestions aimed specifically towards the individual to pursuade them to deposit more in the range of the hundreds, rather than the tens.

We can even use this data to observe the preference of depositing values that are even numbered and "exact" compared to those which are not as "clean" and use a specific amount of cents or dollars. This data can then help with the cryptocurrency apps to make pre-set deposit functions that use those specific values. For example, at ATM machines, they have a certain set of pre-set withdrawls, such as, $20, $40, $60, and $100. This can be implemented in the apps for cryptocurrency to help the customer make quicker deposits, and studies have shown that customers tend to use  pre-set functions more than other functions where the individual must manually put in information.

By collecting the data of how much the user likes to deposit, we can then create custom pre-sets for them. For example, if a user would always deposit money in large amounts such as $400, $500, and $600, the pre-sets can change from $20, $40, $60, and $100, to be $300, $400, $500, and $600.
