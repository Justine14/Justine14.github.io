The data being sent across communication links that I would like to take a look at is the number of 0's being sent across to process cryptocurrency. Since cryptocurrency is a growing trend among individuals now a days, I wanted to be able to count the number of 0's an individual deposits within a year, and take the average of those 0's to determine approximately the average of how much a person deposits or earns. For example, if a person deposits $100.00 for 9 months and $10.00 for 3 months, then it would show that the user likes to deposit in the hundreds since there are two zeroes in front of the decimal point.

This can help with aiming specific philantrophic goals that are within the hundreds towards the individual. In other words, if they like depositing in the hundreds, then they have advertisements aimed specifically towards them to pursuade them to deposit more in the range of the hundreds, rather than the tens or the thousands.
