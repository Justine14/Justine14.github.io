	<u>Interaction Questions:</u>
	1) The allowed interaction helps keep the narrative on track because it only changes once one of the four specific actions take place. Once one of the required actions begins, it does not allow you to complete that action by going through a different action, and only allows you to take one route from the start ot the finish. It permits variations and branches by only allowing you to continue through its loop until it is complete. There is a hint within the program which mentions there are four steps that must take place. What the game then does is go throug 'if' and 'else' conditions. If the player goes this specific direction and interacts with a specific item, then the actions to follow will take place. Else, if the player does not interact with the situation, continue through the loop (game play) until they reach the next day.

	2) I quite enjoyed the graphical quality of this game as it was specifically in black and white colours since the entire theme was based on a dream. Graphics wise, it was nice to have it not so detailed since there did not need to be an emphasis on details. It also helped with the 'dream' theme as in dreams, not so much focus is on the characteristics of objects or people, but more so the actions that were taken within that dream.

	3) Given the nature of the initial interactions with the objects in the game, the player can obtain a regular feel as the actions only take the player through the daily life of a working individual. However, the required actions were very different that did not conform to what an individual would see in their daily lives, which give the player a more alarmed feeling. For example, talking to the homeless and suddently witnessing a grave at a cemetery changes the entire feel of the game, as the player could note that there may not be a happy ending.
